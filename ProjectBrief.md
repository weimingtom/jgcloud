# Introduction #
This document will contain a high level overview of the jgcloud project. It is a "living" document and will be maintained throughout the lifecycle of the project.

# Background #
jgcloud (which is meant to stand for the "Java Game Cloud"). It is the brainchild of Richard Hawkes, a long-time Java developer looking to get his feet wet in the wonderful world of game programming. Java is now becoming a viable option for the development of cross-platform gaming and he believed the time was right to delve in.

# Project Definition #
The project was created for the purpose of developing a game using Java and JMonkeyEngine.

## Objectives ##
Please refer to the BusinessCase objectives.

## Scope/Exclusions ##
The project will endeavour to produce the following:

  * A quorum of keen and talented developers


, artists (computer graphic artists), and sound engineers (if that is the correct term) who want to create a computer game.
  * Once the level of technical expertise has been achieved (the first stage), a game will be devised taking input from all team members. The game should be large enough to be a challenge, but not so large as to make it impossible to write. For instance, it is highly unlikely an MMO will be used.

# Tolerances #
This project is being run as near-as-dammit for nothing. The expense is simply the time that the volunteers are giving to the project itself.

However, there must be some time tolerances introduced and (as much as possible) monitored and controlled to ensure it doesn't just spiral in to a never-ending project.
