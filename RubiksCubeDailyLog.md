# Day 1 #
Created 7 spheres to illustrate the inner pivots of the Rubiks Cube (CorePivotsTutorial). In reality, I will just create dummy nodes as they don't need to be seen.

Found out that negative Z goes out in the distance. I actually thought positive Z would be ahead.

I also created a cylinder in an attempt to create connecting rods between the spheres. I got stuck (and it was late) on working out how to rotate those cylinders to connect nicely. Would it be Quaternions I need?
