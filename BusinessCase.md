# Introduction #
This document will give a brief overview of the business case for the jgcloud project. This document is "alive" and will be continually updated through the lifecycle of this project. As you will see, there are a number of "wooly" sections below that will be revised later.


# Reasons #
Java was never previously a contender for large-scale game programming, but has now very little to stop it! With the introduction of JOGL and the JMonkeyEngine, this is an ideal opportunity to display the capabilities of the Java language.


# Options #
If a game is to be written, it is clear that we will need to use existing tools rather than starting from nothing.

  * JMonkeyEngine has been chosen as the Java 3D engine, as it is mature and reasonably well supported. It allows importing from various 3D editing packages (Blender, Milkshape). It has elements like lighting, animation, rendering etc ready out of the box. It is also free!
  * The 3D editing package is yet to be confirmed. Blender is the preferred option, but is also the trickiest to learn (and therefore probably harder to get skilled resources). There is also now a JME Exporter from Blender, which could save time later. It may be that we use Milkshape (which has a small fee), which is easier to learn but has less functionality.
  * There also remains the issue of where to find the resource. Because we will be using JMonkeyEngine, it's possible we can advertise there. The initial intention should be to keep the project local to the London area, but it may be possible to use remote working/communication.
  * Communication. How will this be done? The proposal is for weekly informal meetings where progress can be assessed. This could be done at home, at a hired venue, or even down the pub. However, the issue of remote communication needs to be addressed. In an ideal world the location would have network and voice communication (to allow for online demo's and telephone communication).


# Benefits Expected #
This project can be seen almost as a feasibility study for a future commercial venture. The aim of this project is to source talented java developers, graphic artists and audio experts and create a small (but enjoyable) computer game. The content of the game itself will be defined in a later stage once it is clear what level of complexity can be achieved within a reasonable timescale.

From a personal perspective, I believe a larger scale Java game such as this, could raise the profile of Java. It also gives the potential for a cross-platform game as (theoretically) the technologies used are OS androgynous.

This project has two key objectives:

  * Create a quorum of keen individuals that will become skilled in the various elements of computer game development.
  * Creation of a small (but not insignificant) open-source game.

It also has the following potential for the following:

  * Additional members may become available on the release of the game who are able to contribute and therefore add further benefit.
  * If it is beleived the project was a success and there is enough commitment, then a commercial venture could be pursued.
  * This effort can be considered philanthropic, as the source code will be made available to the open-source community.
  * It might allow the acquisition of skilled resources with a similar interest.
  * Because of the open-source nature of the project, we should get a lot of the testing done "for free". It is also possible that later stages may allow for the identification of new developers and artists interested in joining the project.
  * This project will be very low cost (unlikely to cost zero) as the resources will all be volunteering their time as part of a learning process.
  * Because of the previous point, it may be possible to move forward to a commercial venture with little R&D


# Risks #
There are unquestionable concerns undertaking a project of this nature. They include:

  * Obtaining resources. Ideally this project should be managed locally (London, UK). But this could be unrealistic. It is probable that we will need 5-10 Java developer, 2-3 artists and 1 audio/sound expert. Even beginning to get hold of that number may prove tricky. Investigation on London based web sites is required to ascertain availability at the outset.
  * Resource quality. How do we ensure we have the right people for the task? I would say that a group of beginners is fine (more fun in fact), but is the underlying skill (eg Java development, artisitic talent) there in the first place?
  * Retaining resources. This project is being undertaken by (effectively) volunteers who may - despite their best intentions - leave the project. I propose we carefully cross-fertilise knowledge between members to mitigate some of this risk (eg the Lighting expert also learns about importing and animation).
  * Impossible to complete. The work may just be too much for any team to do voluntarily. Clear go/no-go points must be placed in this project to ensure it doesn't drag on pointlessly.
  * Unseen costs. This is unlikely, but there may be hidden costs. For instance, if we were to adopt Milkshape as the chosen 3d modelling tool, who would pay for this? A tolerance could be added to address this risk.
