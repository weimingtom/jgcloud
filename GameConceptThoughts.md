# Introduction #

This wiki is a brief brain-dump of my thoughts on what time of game can be written given the constraints (it developers, modellers). It can be removed (replaced) once we are more clear on the prototype.

Clearly the "game" that is written will need to be in some way a challenge. I don't believe it give many hours of interactive gameplay, but the potential to add more content is essential. This will encourage the open-source community to take the code away and enhance/improve it. Although some of them are pretty obvious, I like the "golden rules" being defined [HERE](http://www.theinspiracy.com/Current%20Rules%20Master%20List.htm)

On to the game concept itself. Given the resource constraints, creating any sort of A`*` and AI algorithms maybe overly optimistic. I like the idea of a turn-based strategy, perhaps really simple in a trading-card-game (TCG) style (this would mean the algorithms could be kept very simple in terms of which cards to play). Some general ideas for discussion can be found [HERE](http://gpwiki.org/index.php/Game_Ideas).
